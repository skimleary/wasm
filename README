The following examples come directly from the Rust WASM
tutorial (link here)(nn):

  01-hello_world
  02-dom
  03-canvas
  04-julia_set
  05-webaudio

We use them here to demonstrate building from Rust sources
to WASM targets.

The last example, 06-mandelbrot, comes from the book
"Rust in Action,"(xx) where the program is modified piecemeal
to show the wasm-bindgen interface.


Build
=====

cargo install cargo-edit

cargo add num  # For mandelbrot program


Need make files to build, test, clean, and push demoset
